"Carrie Price, Steward & Bargaining Committee member (2023-4)",img/endorsers/carrie-p.webp,"Tim, Michelle, and Vicki are three of the strongest organizers I have had the pleasure of working with. Their dedication was critical to winning our first contract and those years of hard work have given them the necessary experience to develop an effective strategy that will continue to protect our rights as workers and set us up to win more in future contracts. Each of them has a sense of duty and they share a clear vision for our union, rooted in the core principles of organizing and directly influenced by their relationships with us, the unit members. Combined, they have had thousands of hours of conversations with members all across the unit and I have seen first hand how those relationships have shaped their thinking and sharpened their leadership skills. They care deeply about this union and they won't stop fighting even when the going gets tough. <br><br>I am proud to support them and I look forward to working alongside them to continue to build the strength of the Tech Guild."

In the two years I’ve organized alongside Tim, I’ve seen him as a natural leader—supportive and always there for us. I’m confident Tim would make an exceptional Unit Chair because he not only puts in the work to get things done but is also genuinely committed to understanding the thoughts and concerns of members, ensuring that everyone in our unit feels represented."
