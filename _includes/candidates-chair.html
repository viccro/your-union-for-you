            Our union is at a crossroads. We've built strength, won important
            protections in our first contract, and pushed back when management
            tried to divide us. But we need to grow stronger and that means
            changing how we operate, how we organize, and how we lead.

            I'm running for Unit Chair of the Times Tech Guild to transform the
            status quo. I believe our union should be a place where all members,
            even those who are not organizers, feel informed, included and
            empowered.

          <p class="text-muted">
            I've been a shop steward since September 2022, just three months
            after joining The Times, which meant I was learning my job and how
            to organize at the same time (I'm a notorious multitasker, lol). I
            started by organizing my own team, then grew into chief steward for
            Digital Ads as well as Engineering in Growth and in Data. If you're
            in any of those three missions, I can guarantee I've checked in on
            you, either personally or through your steward, more than once over
            the last three years.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            I've served on several article committees, always making sure my
            members' interests were reflected in our proposals. I co-lead our
            Contract Action Team, planned our first real walkout on Halloween
            2023, and during our strike a year later mobilized 100% Digital Ads
            withheld their labor, with many leading on both the digital or
            physical picket lines. My members show up and fight alongside me
            because they know I show up and fight for them, and I've taken that
            fight straight to our CTO, Jason, and our CEO, Meredith, to stop
            members from being fired or forced out. Currently, I sit on our
            remote work committee assisting members with applications and
            appeals.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            Outside of organizing, I'm a devoted fan of Paradox Interactive,
            board games, Magic: The Gathering (ask me about my Lightning Bolts)
            and, most importantly, my wife Maria.

            As the lead steward in Digital Ads, Growth and Data Platforms during
            our contract campaign, I worked my hardest to represent my members
            in article committees, collective actions, and in planning our
            strike. But despite this, there were still many gaps in
            communication at every level, both between our BC and our stewards
            as well as between our stewards and our rank and file members. As
            Unit Chair I will make it a top priority to communicate clearly and
            regularly with stewards and members about our decisions, our goals,
            and our strategy. Rank and file members shouldn't have to know
            someone on the inside in order to get help or start participating,
            and organizers shouldn't have to guess about overall strategy.
            Misalignment and confusion weakens our actions and costs us wins.

          <h4><strong>A Steward Network to Empower Members</strong></h4>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p class="text-muted">
            Stewards shouldn't feel like another boss, they should be your
            advocates, educators, and organizers. Every rank and file member
            deserves to have such a steward who they trust to both defend their
            jobs and represent their interests, not just those fortunate enough
            to be in particular missions or functions that happen to have more
            organizers with time or capacity for volunteering. Since winning our
            contract, I have already begun working to revitalize our steward
            network, and rebuild it to be consistent, responsive, and
            accountable. As Unit Chair, I intend to work hard to train, support,
            and develop new stewards across our unit in all areas of the
            company: bringing in new leaders and giving them real ownership over
            organizing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            I remember what it felt like to be a newly engaged member, eager to
            help but having to figure out for myself how best to meaningfully
            contribute. I remember the first time as a steward where a concern
            of mine was pushed aside by those with louder voices. In my time as
            a Steward, I have put great effort into making sure any member feels
            welcome and taken seriously in any organizing space whenever they
            decide to pitch in. As Unit Chair, we will organize not just with an
            open door, but with an outstretched hand creating real space for new
            people to step in, lead, and grow.

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p class="text-muted">
            We can't fight for what our members truly need if we don't ask them
            and listen. Our future contract campaigns must be built from the
            ground up, rooted in what members actually want: better
            compensation, stronger job protections, more time back, and fairer
            benefits. Stewards being surprised by member priorities during a
            contract campaign costs us wins and weakens our credibility
            bargaining on behalf of our unit. Further, we need leadership that
            rank and file members trust to truly represent their interests. That
            means a process that engages all members of our unit, not just in
            selecting our bargaining committee's priorities, but also the
            committee itself.
