                        Our union is at a crossroads. We've built strength, won important
                        protections in our first contract, and pushed back when management
                        tried to divide us. But we need to grow stronger to enforce our
                        contract and that means changing how we operate, how we organize,
                        and how we lead.

                        file. I believe our union should be a place where all members,

                        I became a steward in September 2022, only three months after
                        joining The Times. Back then, I was learning my job and how to
                        organize at the same time (I'm a notorious multitasker, lol). I
                        started organizing my own team and later became the lead steward
                        for Digital Ads and Engineering in Data Platforms and Growth. If
                        you’re in those missions, I can guarantee I've checked in on you,
                        either personally or through your steward.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        When bargaining started for our first contract, I made the
                        decision to join several article committees to ensure my members’
                        priorities were represented. When management unlawfully
                        threatened to enforce discipline over RTO during our contract
                        campaign, I worked to plan our first ULP strike on Halloween
                        2023. Soon after, I became a co-lead of our Contract Action Team,
                        organizing collective actions to move us to a contract. I quickly
                        put that experience to work in my steward responsibilities,
                        organizing smaller team-based actions to protect members. During
                        our strike, I mobilized 100% of Digital Ads to withhold their
                        labor, with many taking leadership positions on the picket lines
                        (both digital and in person). Members fight alongside me because
                        they know I will always fight for them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Since our strike, I've continued fighting for members, even
                        escalating certain cases directly to our CTO and CEO when members
                        were being forced out. Currently, I serve on our Remote Work
                        Contract Committee assisting members applying for remote work,
                        and advocating for them in appeals and arbitration.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Outside of organizing, I'm a devoted fan of Paradox Interactive,
                        board games, Magic: The Gathering (ask me about my Lightning Bolts)
                        and, most importantly, my wife Maria.

                </h3>

                <div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">
                    <h4><strong>Stronger Defense for Members and Our Contract</strong></h4>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        My priority has always been defending members when management
                        mistreats them. Even before we had a contract, I would organize
                        teams to protect coworkers from management’s worst decisions, but
                        without guaranteed job protections, the strength of those
                        strategies were limited. Now with the Just Cause protections,
                        contract committees, and grievance provisions provided by our
                        contract, we have powerful new tools to challenge management when
                        they mistreat members. As Unit Chair, I plan to use my experience
                        enforcing our contract and organizing teams to build a union capable
                        of resisting management on multiple fronts. You’ll never doubt
                        whether your union will have your back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        We also need a leader who will block management’s attempts to weaken
                        our contract. In just our first year under contract, we’ve seen
                        their attempts to clawback benefits and erode our rights by
                        reinterpreting layoff protections or circumventing our contract
                        committee processes. As Unit Chair, I will be relentless when
                        pursuing grievances on your behalf, and even in settlements, will
                        make things as expensive as possible for management. So they think
                        twice before violating our contract again.
                    </p>

                <div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">
                    <h4><strong>A Steward Network to Empower Members</strong></h4>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Your Steward shouldn't feel like a second boss, they should be your
                        advocates, educators, and organizers. Every member deserves that
                        support, not just those fortunate enough to be in particular
                        missions or functions where there happen to be more volunteers.
                        Since we won our contract, I have already begun working to
                        revitalize and rebuild our steward network to be consistent,
                        responsive, and accountable. This is how we will build community
                        and enforce our contract everywhere across our unit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        I remember what it felt like to be a newly engaged member, eager
                        to help but having to figure out for myself how best to
                        meaningfully contribute. I even remember the first time as a
                        steward where concerns I had for members of my team were pushed
                        aside by those with louder voices who viewed the issue as "too
                        small". As Unit Chair, I intend to put great effort into ensuring
                        that any member, no matter how new, feels welcome in our
                        organizing spaces, and that stewards are always supported in
                        advocating for the concerns of teams and individual members.
                    </p>

                <div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">
                    <h4><strong>Open Communication</strong></h4>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        As a former lead steward, I saw how gaps in communication
                        weakened us. Decisions didn’t always flow clearly between our
                        bargaining committee, stewards, and members. As your Unit Chair,
                        I will make it a top priority to communicate clearly and
                        regularly with stewards and members about our decisions, our
                        goals, and our strategy. You shouldn’t have to know someone on
                        the inside to get help or start participating, and organizers
                        shouldn’t be left guessing at our plans. Opaque decisions and
                        poor communication erodes trust and creates misalignment, which
                        weakens participation and makes it harder to push back against
                        management.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Communication must also be two-way. We win only when we fight
                        for what members care about and our future actions and contract
                        campaigns must be rooted in members real priorities: better
                        compensation, stronger job protections, more time back, and
                        fairer benefits. Stewards being surprised by member priorities
                        during a contract campaign costs us wins and weakens our
                        credibility, as does choosing a bargaining committee without
                        the input of our rank and file. As unit chair, your priorities
                        will be mine as well.
