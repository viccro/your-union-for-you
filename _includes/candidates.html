            <h3>Michelle Esposito for Vice Chair</h3>
            <h4 class="engineer-title">Program Manager 2, Platforms Pillar</h4>

            <p>
              I became a shop steward in April 2022 and a "steward little" since
              early 2021. I now belong to several volunteer committees including
              the Member Data, Union Onboarding, and Stewards Network Overhaul
              working groups.
            </p>

            <p>
              My project management skills; the organizing of people and teams
              toward a common goal, are basically directly transferable to union
              organizing. This is why I enjoy this work so much - it is
              essentially my career and life's work.
            </p>

            <p>
              My crowning organizing achievement to date was coordinating with
              stewards across our unit to empower members and collect a
              supermajority of signatures on our Strike Authorization Vote
              Pledge. This enabled us to schedule a vote with an confidently
              strong outcome. I knew a strong vote in favor to strike (95%)
              would finally get us a compensation counter from management and it
              did.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also led several successful actions, notably organizing team
              leads of Elections Readiness critical teams to use
              union-supportive backgrounds for the August Stress Test.
            </p>

            <p><strong>My priorities include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mobilizing and keeping the stewards' network accountable to our
                members and strong in our support of members
              </li>
              <li>
                Organizing and processing member data to keep an accurate pulse
                on the strength of our unit
              </li>
              <li>
                Onboarding and welcoming new members, empowering them to
                participate in our union!
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In addition to organizing for our unit I also volunteer on my
              building's co-op board and I mentor a young student in college. My
              other hobbies and personal interests include playing cards with
              friends, pub trivia, karaoke, horror movies, dancing, fishing,
              scuba diving, and skiing. I also enjoy traveling and have aimed to
              visit one new country per year. This year was Japan, next year I
              don't know yet. Open to suggestions!

            <h3>Vicki Crosson for Secretary</h3>
            <h4 class="engineer-title">
              Sr Engineer in DevP - Remote from Boston
            </h4>

            <p>
              I'm the current secretary of Times Tech, and I'm running for
              another term. My lived experience as an autistic/ADHD wheelchair
              user shapes my belief that solidarity means protecting
              <strong>everyone</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              My union involvement started with our underground organizing
              committee, and I've been deeply engaged ever since. I served on
              the bargaining committee, where I stood across the table from
              management at its most combative — I'm ready to do it again.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most powerful actions I've been part of was the RTO
              pledge. When the company threatened illegal discipline during
              status quo, we pledged that if one person was punished, we'd all
              walk out. We were ready, and management backed down. That's where
              I see our solidarity shine: any of us can become “the little guy”
              in an instant, so we have to stand strong together for everyone,
              every time.
            </p>
            <p>
              As secretary, I've built and maintained the systems that keep our
              large unit running, managed the strike fund, ensured rallies and
              pickets are accessible as possible, onboarded new members, and
              served on the Grievance Committee fighting for members' rights.
              Beyond our unit, I've pushed the NYGuild executive committee to
              take stronger stances as NYGuild secretary, built solidarity by
              exchanging proposals with other tech unions, spoken on panels
              about disability justice, supported new organizing
              drives (including Wirecutter/TA tech), and helped establish a Local
              emergency fund.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My priorities for the future:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Protecting members from retaliation and illegal discipline
              </li>
              <li>
                Preserving institutional memory and ensuring organizational
                continuity
              </li>
              <li>Expanding accessibility and centering disability justice</li>
              <li>
                Elevating minority voices and making sure decisions are led by
                impacted members — “nothing about us without us”
              </li>
              <li>
                Building solidarity across units and industries so our
                collective power grows stronger
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>I'm not here to push my own agenda — I'm here to make sure we
                protect each other, stay organized, and build the power we need
                to win.</strong
              >

            <p>
              I enjoy quilting, language learning (Russian, Japanese, Spanish &
              Quechua so far), and serving on my town's disability commission. I
              was a street medic, and still maintain my EMT license. I earned a
              Library & Information Science MS (while bargaining!), and I love
              scary books, women's hockey, musicals, and trying to keep our two
              cats — Maz (pictured) and Roger Roger — busy. Fun fact: I had a
              Star Wars wedding, and I sewed my own dress!
